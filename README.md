## How to Use

esm.sh is a modern CDN that allows you to import
[es6 modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
from a URL:

```js
import Module from "https://esm.sh/PKG@SEMVER[/PATH]";
```

or build a module with custom input(code):

```js
import { esm } from "https://esm.sh/build";

const { render } = await esm`
  /* @jsx h */
  import { h } from "npm:preact@10.13.2";
  import { renderToString } from "npm:preact-render-to-string@6.0.2";
  export const render () => renderToString(<h1>Hello world!</h1>);
`;
console.log(render()); // "<h1>Hello world!</h1>"
```

> More usage check out [here](#building-module-with-custom-inputcode).

You may want to use _**bare specifier**_ instead of URL with [import maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps):

```html
<script type="importmap">
  {
    "imports": {
      "react": "https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0"
    }
  }
</script>
<script type="module">
  import React from "react" // alias to https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0
</script>
```

### Importing from NPM

```js
import React from "https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0";
```

You may also use a [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver) or a
[dist-tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-dist-tag) instead of a
fixed version number, or omit the version/tag entirely to use the `latest` tag:

```js
import React from "https://esm.sh/react";        // 18.2.0 (latest)
import React from "https://esm.sh/react@^17";    // 17.0.2
import React from "https://esm.sh/react@canary"; // 18.3.0-canary-e1ad4aa36-20230601
```

You can import submodules of a package:

```js
import { renderToString } from "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.2.0/server";
```

or import/fetch non-module(js) as following:

```js
import "https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0/package.json" assert { type: "json" };
```

### Importing from GitHub

esm.sh supports to import modules/assets from a github repo:
`/gh/OWNER/REPO[@TAG]/PATH`. For example:

```js
import tslib from "https://esm.sh/gh/microsoft/tslib@2.6.0";
```

or load a svg image from a github repo:
https://esm.sh/gh/microsoft/fluentui-emoji/assets/Party%20popper/Color/party_popper_color.svg

### Specifying Dependencies

By default, esm.sh rewrites import specifiers based on the package dependencies.
To specify the version of these dependencies, you can add the
`?deps=PACKAGE@VERSION` query. To specify multiple dependencies, separate them
with a comma, like this: `?deps=react@17.0.2,react-dom@17.0.2`.

```js
import React from "https://esm.sh/react@17.0.2";
import useSWR from "https://esm.sh/swr?deps=react@17.0.2";
```

### Aliasing Dependencies

```js
import useSWR from "https://esm.sh/swr?alias=react:preact/compat";
```

in combination with `?deps`:

```js
import useSWR from "https://esm.sh/swr?alias=react:preact/compat&deps=preact@10.5.14";
```

The original idea came from
[@lucacasonato](https://github.com/lucacasonato).

### Tree Shaking

By default, esm.sh exports a module with all its exported members. However, if
you want to import only a specific set of members, you can specify them by
adding a `?exports=foo,bar` query to the import statement.

```js
import { __await, __rest } from "https://esm.sh/tslib"; // 7.3KB
import { __await, __rest } from "https://esm.sh/tslib?exports=__await,__rest"; // 489B
```

By using this feature, you can take advantage of tree shaking with esbuild and
achieve a smaller bundle size. **Note** that this feature is only supported for
ESM modules and not CJS modules.

### Bundling Strategy

By default, esm.sh bundles sub-modules that ain't declared in the `exports` field.

Bundling deps can reduce the number of network requests and improve performance.
However, it may bundle shared code repeatedly. In extreme case, it may break the
side effects of the package, or change the `import.meta.url` pointing. To avoid
this, you can add `?bundless` to disable the default bundling behavior:

```js
import "https://esm.sh/@pyscript/core?bundless";
```

For package authors, you can specify the bundling strategy by adding the `esm.sh`
field to `package.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "name": "foo",
  "esm.sh": {
    "bundle": false, // disables bundling behavior
  }
}
```

esm.sh supports `?standalone` query to bundle all dependencies(except deps in `peerDependencies`)
into a single JS file.

```js
import { Button } from "https://esm.sh/antd?standalone";
```

### Development Mode

```js
import React from "https://esm.sh/react?dev";
```

With the `?dev` option, esm.sh builds a module with `process.env.NODE_ENV` set
to `"development"` or based on the condition `development` in the `exports`
field. This is useful for libraries that have different behavior in development
and production. For example, React will use a different warning message in
development mode.

### ESBuild Options

By default, esm.sh checks the `User-Agent` header to determine the build target.
You can also specify the `target` by adding `?target`, available targets are:
**es2015** - **es2022**, **esnext**, **deno**, **denonext**, **node** and
**bun**.

```js
import React from "https://esm.sh/react?target=es2020";
```

Other supported options of esbuild:

- [Conditions](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#conditions)
  ```js
  import foo from "https://esm.sh/foo?conditions=custom1,custom2";
  ```
- [Keep names](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#keep-names)
  ```js
  import foo from "https://esm.sh/foo?keep-names";
  ```
- [Ignore annotations](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#ignore-annotations)
  ```js
  import foo from "https://esm.sh/foo?ignore-annotations";
  ```

### Web Worker

esm.sh supports `?worker` query to load the module as a web worker:

```js
import workerFactory from "https://esm.sh/monaco-editor/esm/vs/editor/editor.worker?worker";

const worker = workerFactory();
```

You can pass some custom code snippet to the worker when calling the factory
function:

```js
const workerAddon = `
self.onmessage = function (e) {
  console.log(e.data)
}
`;
const worker = workerFactory(workerAddon);
```

### Package CSS

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://esm.sh/monaco-editor?css">
```

This only works when the package **imports CSS files in JS** directly.

### Importing WASM Modules

esm.sh supports importing wasm modules in JS directly, to do that, you need to
add `?module` query to the import URL:

```js
import wasm from "https://esm.sh/@dqbd/tiktoken@1.0.3/tiktoken_bg.wasm?module";

const { exports } = new WebAssembly.Instance(wasm, imports);
```

## Using Import Maps

[**Import Maps**](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps) has been supported by
most modern browsers and Deno natively. This allows _**bare import
specifiers**_, such as `import React from "react"`, to work.

esm.sh supports `?external=foo,bar` query to specify external dependencies. With
this query, esm.sh will not rewrite the import specifiers of the specified
dependencies. For example:

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "preact": "https://esm.sh/preact@10.7.2",
    "preact-render-to-string": "https://esm.sh/preact-render-to-string@5.2.0?external=preact"
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can **mark all dependencies as external** by adding a `*`
prefix before the package name:

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "preact": "https://esm.sh/preact@10.7.2",
    "preact-render-to-string": "https://esm.sh/*preact-render-to-string@5.2.0",
    "swr": "https://esm.sh/*swr@1.3.0",
    "react": "https://esm.sh/preact@10.7.2/compat"
  }
}
```

Import maps supports
[**trailing slash**](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps#packages-via-trailing-slashes)
that can not work with URL search params friendly. To fix this issue, esm.sh
provides a special format for import URL that allows you to use query params
with trailing slash: change the query prefix `?` to `&` and put it after the
package version.

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "react-dom": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.2.0?pin=v135&dev",
    "react-dom/": "https://esm.sh/react-dom@18.2.0&pin=v135&dev/"
  }
}
```

> esm.sh also provides a [CLI Script](#using-cli-script) in Deno to generate and
> update the import maps that resolves dependencies automatically.

### Escape Hatch: Raw Source Files

In rare cases, you may want to request JS source files from packages, as-is,
without transformation into ES modules. To do so, you need to add a `?raw`
query to the request URL.

For example, you might need to register a package's source script as a service worker
in a browser that [does not yet support](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_serviceworker_ecmascript_modules)
the `type: "module"` option:

```js
await navigator.serviceWorker.register(
  new URL(
    "https://esm.sh/playground-elements/playground-service-worker.js?raw",
    import.meta.url.href
  ),
  { scope: '/' }
);
```

You may alternatively use `raw.esm.sh` as the origin, which is equivalent to
`esm.sh/PATH?raw`:

```html
<playground-project sandbox-base-url="https://raw.esm.sh/playground-elements/"
></playground-project>
```

so that transitive references in the raw assets will also be raw requests.

## Deno Compatibility

esm.sh is a **Deno-friendly** CDN that resolves Node's built-in modules (such as
**fs**, **os**, **net**, etc.), making it compatible with Deno.

```js
import express from "https://esm.sh/express";

const app = express();
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello World");
});
app.listen(3000);
```

For users using deno `< 1.33.2`, esm.sh uses
[deno.land/std@0.177.1/node](https://deno.land/std@0.177.1/node) as the node
compatibility layer. You can specify a different version by adding the
`?deno-std=$VER` query:

```js
import postcss from "https://esm.sh/express?deno-std=0.128.0";
```

Deno supports type definitions for modules with a `types` field in their
`package.json` file through the `X-TypeScript-Types` header. This makes it
possible to have type checking and auto-completion when using those modules in
Deno.
([link](https://deno.land/manual/typescript/types#using-x-typescript-types-header)).

![Figure #1](./server/embed/assets/sceenshot-deno-types.png)

In case the type definitions provided by the `X-TypeScript-Types` header are
incorrect, you can disable it by adding the `?no-dts` query to the module import
URL:

```js
import unescape from "https://esm.sh/lodash/unescape?no-dts";
```

This will prevent the `X-TypeScript-Types` header from being included in the
network request, and you can manually specify the types for the imported module.

## Supporting Nodejs/Bun

Nodejs(18+) supports http importing under the `--experimental-network-imports`
flag. Bun doesn't support http modules yet.

We highly recommend [Reejs](https://ree.js.org/) as the runtime with esm.sh that
works both in Nodejs and Bun.

## Using CLI Script

**esm.sh** provides a CLI script for managing imports with import maps in
[Deno](https://deno.land) and Node/Bun (via [Reejs](https://ree.js.org/)). This
CLI script automatically resolves dependencies and uses a pinned build version
for stability.

To use the esm.sh CLI script, you first need to run the `init` command in your
project's root directory:

```bash
deno run -A -r https://esm.sh init
```

Once you've initialized the script, you can use the following commands to manage
your imports:

```bash
# Adding packages
deno task esm:add react react-dom     # add multiple packages
deno task esm:add react@17.0.2        # specify version
deno task esm:add react:preact/compat # using alias

# Updating packages
deno task esm:update react react-dom  # update specific packages
deno task esm:update                  # update all packages

# Removing packages
deno task esm:remove react react-dom
```

The CLI script works with Node/Bun via [Reejs](https://ree.js.org/):

```bash
# Initializing
reejs x https://esm.sh init
# Using reejs tasks like deno tasks above
reejs task esm:add    react
reejs task esm:update react
reejs task esm:remove react
```

## Building Module with Custom Input(code)

This is an **_experimental_** API that allows you to build a module with custom
input(code).

- Imports NPM/GH packages
- Supports TS/JSX syntaxes
- Bundle mulitple modules into a single JS file

```js
import build from "https://esm.sh/build";

const ret = await build({
  dependencies: {
    "preact": "^10.13.2",
    "preact-render-to-string": "^6.0.2",
  },
  code: `
    /* @jsx h */
    import { h } from "preact";
    import { renderToString } from "preact-render-to-string";
    export const render () => renderToString(<h1>Hello world!</h1>);
  `,
  // for types checking and LSP completion
  types: `
    export function render(): string;
  `,
});

// import module
const { render } = await import(ret.url);
// import bundled module
const { render } = await import(ret.bundleUrl);

render(); // "<h1>Hello world!</h1>"
```

or use the `esm` tag function to build and import js/ts snippet quickly in
browser with npm packages:

```js
import { esm } from "https://esm.sh/build";

const { render } = await esm`
  /* @jsx h */
  import { h } from "npm:preact@10.13.2";
  import { renderToString } from "npm:preact-render-to-string@6.0.2";
  export const render () => renderToString(<h1>Hello world!</h1>);
`;
console.log(render()); // "<h1>Hello world!</h1>"
```

## Pinning Build Version

To ensure stable and consistent behavior, you may want to pin the build version
of a module you're using from esm.sh. This helps you avoid potential breaking
changes in the module caused by updates to the esm.sh server.

The `?pin` query allows you to specify a specific build version of a module,
which is an **immutable** cached version stored on the esm.sh CDN.

```js
import React from "https://esm.sh/react-dom?pin=v135";
// or use version prefix
import React from "https://esm.sh/v135/react-dom";
```

By using the `?pin` query in the import statement, you can rest assured that the
version of the module you're using will not change, even if updates are pushed
to the esm.sh server. This helps ensure the stability and reliability of your
application.

For UI libraries like _React_ and _Vue_, esm.sh uses a special build version
`stable` to ensure single version of the library is used in the whole
application.

## Global CDN
